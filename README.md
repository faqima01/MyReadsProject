# MyReads Project

This project was built on the starter template of MyReads project. I added all of the interactivity and functionalities using React components with JS ES6. The components are placed in the Components directory.

## How to start it

To get started developing right away:

-   install all project dependencies with `npm install`
-   start the development server with `npm start`
